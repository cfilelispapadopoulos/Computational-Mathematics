Introduction
============
The AFIIM package includes the implementation of the Adaptive Factored Incomplete Inverse Matrix preconditioning technique in C
programming language. The package also includes an implementation of the Explicit Preconditioned Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized
iterative method based on the AFIIM scheme. Functions for reading Matrix Market files are also provided.


Installation
============
Compilation is performed by the following process:
   make

Before ``make'' the full Intel environment (Intel oneAPI) should be sourced, i.e: source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

External Libraries
==================
This AFIIM package requires the following external libraries:

Intel oneAPI - This library contains optimized verions of BLAS, LAPACK and other software packages and is required by EPBiCGSTAB. The
	       library can be downloaded from https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-download.html for
               different operating systems.


Example Programs
================
The directory example/ includes an example file on how to use the AFIIM package to solve large unsymmetric sparse linear systems.

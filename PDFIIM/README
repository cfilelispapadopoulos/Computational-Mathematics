Introduction
============
The PDFIIM package includes the implementation of the Parallel Dynamic Factored Incomplete Inverse Matrix preconditioning technique 
in C++ programming language. The package also includes an implementation of the Explicit Preconditioned Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized
iterative method based on the PDFIIM scheme. Functions for reading and writing Matrix Market files are also provided.


Installation
============
Building the PDFIIM software is performed by the issuing the following command on the root folder:
   make

Before issuing ``make'' command in the terminal, the full Intel environment (Intel oneAPI) should be (initially installed and then) 
sourced, i.e: source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh.

External Libraries
==================
This PDFIIM package requires the following external libraries:

Intel oneAPI - This library contains optimized verions of BLAS, LAPACK and other software packages and is required by EPBiCGSTAB. The
	       library can be downloaded from https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-download.html for
               different operating systems.


Example Programs
================
The directory example/ includes an example file on how to use the PDFIIM package to solve large unsymmetric sparse linear systems.
The number of threads for parallel execution is controlled by the environmental variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=nthreads`.

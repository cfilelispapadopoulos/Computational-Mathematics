# Computational Mathematics Software

This repository contains codes from the field of Computational Mathematics, corresponding to scientific publications.

## Preconditioning
- AFIIM - Adaptive Factored Incomplete Inverse Matrix with robust filtering ($$\alpha FIIM (\epsilon)$$) [1]


## Important Note
All software depending on Intel MKL may present differences in results for different MKL versions. Moreover, differences
may occur also when the software is executed in differnt hardware.

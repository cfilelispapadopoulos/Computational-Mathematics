# Computational Mathematics Software

This repository contains codes from the field of Computational Mathematics, corresponding to scientific publications.

## Preconditioning
- AFIIM  - Adaptive Factored Incomplete Inverse Matrix with robust filtering ($$\alpha FIIM (\epsilon)$$) [1]
- DPFIIM - Dynamic Pattern Factored Incomplete Inverse Matrix $$(DPFIIM(k,\ell,m,\epsilon))$$ [2] 


## Important Note
All software depending on Intel MKL may present differences in results for different MKL versions. Moreover, differences
may occur also when the software is executed in different hardware.
